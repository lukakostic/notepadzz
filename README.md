# notepadzz
Minimalistic notes with markdown, keep-unsaved and toggleable UI  
Made with Qt5 in C++.

suckless mentallity, keep the config as part of source code and not at runtime.


best usecase is when taking notes you hide all the ui,  
disable window decorations,  
and then you have just a floating textbox for taking notes:
