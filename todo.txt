fresh startup looks horrid: 
- no initial panel sizing
- no initial tab is open (bad, can crash) so user needs to ctrl+N


save selected tab index / path.


block textbox when no tab present (0 tabs). write "make a new tab with Ctrl+N." as placeholder


what happens when multiple windows open? (warn or dont open..)


dragging a tab outside window makes it dissapear

horizontal tabs scroll selects them instead of scrolling. AND ITS TOO FAST.
(need smooth scroll, not selection scroll.)
